This Project is based upon the SIH 2022 problem by Ministry of heritage and tourism . 

                                                          PROBLEM STATEMENT 

There are a lot of monuments and heritage sites in India where people from india and outside India visit . This is one the big industry of India .
The government charges some charges for tickets to visit the places . But this industry is lack the management . 

People have to stand in long queue  to buy the tickets near the ticket counters. On weekends they may have to stand more than hours and some time tickets get sold out.
It becomes tedious task for  people to stand in unfavourable climate , and after so long they sometimes don't get the tickets even . 
Even the staff have to suffer due to unawareness of how much people would be present at certain day for tickets . If they know how much people are going to visit that day 
then monuments staff could manage in advance. 

Ministry raised the problem to make software based solution to make Paperless e-ticket system which generate  QR code as tickets.




                                                              OUR SOLUTION 
                                                              
We solved the problem by making a android based software which shows the number of tickets availaible to tourist . Tourist can buy the tickets in advanced .
The ticket would be present in the form QR code which would be sent to the person in the form of password protected  pdf to tourist email which could only be opened with 
passsword known to the person who booked .

The   QR  CODE would get expired after that day so that it can,t be reused.
